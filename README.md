# Pygame Voxel Engine
 Voxel Engine made with Python using Pygame



Followed Coder Space's tutorial on "Creating a Voxel Engine (like Minecraft) from scratch in Python" and made my own changes to it. 
If you wish to have a similiar product, feel free to fork this repository or follow Coder Space's tutorial on Youtube. 
I do not claim the idea to be original as my part of the work is only an alternation of the original.
